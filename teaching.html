  <h2>Insect Diversity ENTM 5300/6300</h2>
  <h3>Credits: 4</h3>
  <p>This is a survey of the diversity of insects, stressing taxon diagnostics and other kinds of practical analysis.</p>
  <h3>Format</h3>
  <p>This is a blended course. We use Canvas to do the primary information transfer stuff, and our face-to-face time to reiterate key concepts and practice applying what we've learned.</p>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <ol>
  
    <li>Describe insect diversity, what it’s worth, where it comes from, and how we keep track of it.</li>
  
    <li>Solve insect classification problems by analyzing and evaluating morphological data.</li>
  
    <li>Connect diagnostic morphological variation to evolved functional diversity.</li>
  
    <li>Apply biodiversity science approaches to address real-world problems.</li>
  
  </ol>
  <h3>Texts</h3>
  <ul>
  
    <li>Johnson NF, Triplehorn CA. 2004. Borror and DeLong’s Introduction the Study of Insects. Required. Not without flaw, but the most comprehensive resource for identifying North American insect families.</li>
  
  </ul>

  <h2>Practical Evolution ENTM 7230</h2>
  <h3>Credits: 3</h3>
  <p>Students learn evolutionary biology by making it happen, that is, by building and running simulation models. They also learn of opportunities to apply evolutionary theory to practical problems in agriculture, public health and conservation. Classical population genetics is elegant but arcane. Our simulation approach aims to make it more intuitive, and also more realistic and practical.</p>
  <h3>Format</h3>
  <p>This is a blended course; we use a mix of face-to-face and online teaching modalities. We use Canvas, Auburn’s learning management system, to host lesson materials and assessments, manage the submission of assignments, and coordinate team-based learning activities. We use face-to-face sessions to reiterate key concepts, and to work together to apply those concepts in simulation models.</p>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <ol>
  
    <li>Describe and interpret fundamental theories in evolutionary population biology.</li>
  
    <li>Use simulations to test and extend that theory.</li>
  
    <li>Apply population biology approaches to real-world problems.</li>
  
  </ol>
  <h3>Texts</h3>
  <ul>
  
    <li>For our simulations, we will be using the SLiM 4 (Selection on Linked Mutations) framework, and we will be using the SLiM 3 manual as a textbook.</li>
  
  </ul>
